Userstyle(s) to adjust Skype for small-resolution displays.

This userstyle is meant for use in Firefox for Android to adjust Skype for Web for small displays â€” those at width of 500 pixels or less, and specifically displays with a 320x480px resolution.

Use cases: In devices with Android 2.3, where the Skype app has ceased working, Firefox for Android can be configured to pose as a desktop browser, thus enabling use of Skype for Web.

# Caveats
Note, that this only works with text-based messaging. Do not expect use of video or audio.

# Legal
The userstyle is free to use by anyone. No copyright infringment is intended.
