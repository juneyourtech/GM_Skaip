Userstyle(s) to adjust Skype for small-resolution displays.

This userstyle is meant for use in Firefox for Android to adjust Skype for Web for small displays â€” those at width of 500 pixels or less, and specifically displays with a 320x480px resolution.

Use cases: In devices with Android 2.3, where the Skype app has ceased working, Firefox for Android can be configured to pose as a desktop browser, thus enabling use of Skype for Web.

# Requirements
* Firefox for Android
* Stylish extension
* Firefox must be configured in about:config to identify itself as Firefox for desktop to all top-level Skype-related domains.

# Considerations
* NoScript must be configured to permit all Skype-related domains.
* I have not tested this with any other Firefox add-ons, such as adblockers.

# Caveats
* Note, that this only works with text-based messaging. Do not expect use of video or audio.
* Skype for Web in Android Firefox can be very slow on older devices; particularly those with slow CPUs and low amounts of RAM memory. YMMV.

# Legal
The userstyle is free to use by anyone. No copyright infringment is intended.
